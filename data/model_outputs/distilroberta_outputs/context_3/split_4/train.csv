76.2,41,"B (teward): MrPuppet69: the same concept applies here: they could have your Public Key, and your Private Key, but since your Private Key is encrypted, they either need to brute force the password you set on it, or they need the password, to actually authenticate as the private key B (teward): MrPuppet69: because it's encrypted simply having the encrypted private key doesn't help them since they can't put the password that would 'decrypt' the encrypted private key for use B (teward): MrPuppet69: the nearest analogy is that ""private info in the safe vs. public disclosed info on the same thing"" example I just gave you - they don't know the pincode to the safe so they can't get to the private information B (teward): MrPuppet69: similarly, without your password or brute forcing the password, your encrypted private key is of no real use to them B (teward): MrPuppet69: but your actual concern shouldn't be ""What if they get my key"", your concern at that point is ""If they have my encrypted private key they're in my system."" B (teward): MrPuppet69: and the moment they're in your system, you are quite literally screwed. B (teward): MrPuppet69: so I'd be less worried about your private key which is encrypted.
