78.2,5,"A (tincan): i have a bit of a quandary on my hands in concerns to memory. when i first start ubuntu 14.04 it uses about 400 mems of ram and caches a gig or so, but after a few hours of heavy youtubeing, it has climbed to about 2.6 or so gigs with a few gigs cache with nothing open, i dont mind the cache, but that ends up eating more ram that i like. has anyone had a similiar problem, and if so did they find a solution?
