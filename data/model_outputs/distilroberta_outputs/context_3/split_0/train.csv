Who knows whats going wrong here! B (jrib): geekbri: i have no experience with buildr.  Maybe it uses sh?  try <unconvertable> sudo dpkg-reconcfigure dash <unconvertable> and have sh point to bash temporarily just to see if it changes buildr's behavior A (geekbri): jrib: excellent point.. hopefully that is not the case.
